Medication feature — simple, fresher-friendly story

Below is a plain, step-by-step explanation of how the medication functionality should behave in the app. I’m avoiding any database talk — just the user flows, what the app does, and the important rules to handle edge cases.

1) Actors & high level goal

	Doctor: Prescribes medication to a patient (selects from list or adds a custom one).

	Patient: Sees prescribed medications, follows schedule, marks doses as taken/missed, and views history/analytics.

	System: Creates daily dose schedules from the prescription info, tracks intake, shows reminders and reports.

2) Create / prescribe a medication (what happens when the doctor adds a med)

	Doctor opens the medication library and picks a medication (or creates a custom medication if not found).

	App shows medication details (name, brand, strength, form).

	Doctor (or patient) fills in:

		Start date and End date.

		Medication periods — e.g. Morning, Afternoon, Evening. Each period can have a time: Morning → 9:00 AM, Evening → 8:00 PM. (Periods are multi-select.)

		Intake pattern / frequency — e.g. DAILY, Weekly Once, Weekly Twice, or a custom pattern.

		Days of week (if pattern is weekly): e.g. [Mon, Wed, Fri].

		Before/After meal flag for each period (if needed).

		Notes (instructions, dosage description).

		On submit, the app creates the schedule for each day in the date range according to chosen periods, frequency, and days-of-week.

		Example: Start = Sep 1, End = Sep 30, Days = Mon/Wed/Fri, Periods = Morning@9:00 & Evening@8:00 → the app creates dose entries for every Mon/Wed/Fri between Sep 1–30,
		each with two times (9:00, 8:00).

3) How the schedule works (user-facing)

	The patient sees a list/calendar of upcoming doses (today, next 7 days, or full schedule).

	For today the app lists all dose entries (time, med name, dose description, before/after meal).

	Each dose entry has actions:

		Mark as Taken (and optionally the taken time; default = now).

		Mark as Missed (or it becomes missed automatically if time passes and not marked).

		Snooze / Reschedule (small delay) — optional.

		View Medication Info (opens the med details and instructions).

		When a dose is taken, the app stores that intake record with timestamp and status.

4) Intake tracking (how we know taken vs missed)

	Every scheduled dose has a status: Pending → Taken / Missed.

	If the patient taps Taken, the app records the time and marks it taken.

	If the scheduled time passes and the patient did not mark it, the system can automatically mark as Missed (based on a configurable grace window), 
	or leave it pending and allow manual marking later — define business rule.

	The patient can correct mistakes (e.g., mark a past dose as Taken if they forgot to tap at the time).

5) Viewing & filtering schedules and history

	Provide filters:

		Date range (Today, Last 7 days, Custom range).

		Status (All / Taken / Missed / Pending).

		Medication name.

	Today view: All doses scheduled for the date — easy to see what’s left.

	History view: See past days with status and timestamps; useful for adherence checks.

	Future view: See upcoming doses until the end date.

6) Editing a prescription (what must happen)

	When user/doctor edits start/end dates, periods, or frequency:

	If start/end date changed:

		If the end date was shortened → remove scheduled doses that fall after the new end date (but keep historical intake records).

		If the end date was extended → create new scheduled doses from the old end date+1 to the new end.

	If medication periods changed (e.g., add Afternoon@2:00):

		Add scheduled doses for the new period on relevant dates between start and end.

		If a period is removed → remove pending scheduled doses for that period (do not delete past intake records).

	If days-of-week or frequency changed:

		Recompute the schedule for the whole date range: remove any pending schedule entries that no longer match and create new ones that match the new pattern.

		When opening the Edit screen, show the original configuration (start/end, periods with times, frequency, selected weekdays, before/after meal) 
		so user can see and change exactly what was configured.

		Important: Never delete intake history (taken/missed records). Only remove future/pending schedule entries that are no longer valid.

7) Handling special cases & validation

	If a custom medication is entered (i.e., not in the library), allow quick create + use it in the same flow.

	Validate that start date ≤ end date.

	Validate that at least one period/time is supplied.

	If frequency is weekly but no weekdays are selected → show error.

	Support overlapping prescriptions: if the same medication is added twice with overlapping dates, show a warning or allow multiple prescriptions but indicate overlaps clearly.

	Timezone / daylight saving: store times in a consistent way so schedule times don’t shift unexpectedly for the user.

	Grace window: decide how long after scheduled time a dose can still be marked as taken (e.g., 2 hours).

8) Notifications & reminders

	Send push/reminder notifications at scheduled dose times (opt-in).

	Optionally send a summary reminder in the morning with all day’s meds.

	If a dose is missed, optionally send a follow-up notification after a grace period.

9) Reporting / dashboard / weekly chart

	Show a weekly adherence chart: e.g., bar for each day showing number of doses scheduled vs taken vs missed.

	Provide simple KPIs:

		Adherence % = (taken doses / scheduled doses) × 100 for a chosen period.

		Streaks — consecutive days with full adherence (optional).

		Allow export or sharing of history for doctor review (CSV or PDF).

10) UX suggestions (how screens should feel)

	Medication Library screen: searchable list; tapping an item shows details and “Prescribe” button.

	Create Prescription screen: simple form with date pickers, multi-select periods that expand to set time and before/after meal, frequency dropdown, weekdays checkboxes.

	Today screen: timeline of doses grouped by time slots (morning/afternoon/evening). Each item large tappable buttons for Taken / Missed.

	History screen: calendar + list; tappable days with summary and drill-in to details.

	Edit Prescription screen: show current config and explain consequences (e.g., “If you shorten the end date, future schedules will be removed”).

11) Example flow (concrete)

	Doctor prescribes “Amox 500mg” starting Oct 1, ending Oct 14.

	Periods selected: Morning@9:00, Evening@8:00. Frequency: DAILY.

	App generates 14 days × 2 times = 28 scheduled dose entries.

	On Oct 3 patient opens Today view: shows two entries (9:00 and 8:00).

	At 9:05 patient taps Taken → system marks entry as taken with timestamp.

	At 8:00 patient misses the dose and forgets → after 2 hours the system marks it Missed or shows as missed next day depending on rule.

	On Oct 10 doctor extends end date to Oct 21 → system generates additional schedule entries for Oct 15–21 accordingly.

12) Summary — minimal checklist for implementation team

	UI: Create / Edit / Today / History screens with clear inputs.

	Schedule engine: given start/end, periods (with times), frequency, and weekdays → generate per-day dose entries.

	Intake actions: Taken / Missed / Snooze, with timestamps.

	Editing rules: remove only future/pending entries that no longer apply; keep history.

	Filters & reports: date-range filter, status filter, weekly adherence chart.

	Notifications: remind at dose times, with configurable grace window.

	Validation: ensure valid date ranges and required fields.
	

My Medication Functionalist
============================================================
We have PatientMedicationSchedule.java  and related table, so i want to create a same table as 
PatientMedicationMenuList there i want to keep the same informations like PatientMedicationSchedule table,
 but there i will add the record while user adding a medication if he select add to my medication 
 then we will keep the record here as well one more column we will keep that is patientId so that
 we can easlily get patient related all the medication list specific to the user.

if he want to update anything then also he can easily update the records, so please create a similar table 
for me and please prepare the script also what i want to execute.

please don't implment anything for now, give me the plan as well show me the codes what you want to change 
then we will proceed for implementation.
